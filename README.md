# Pacman Real-time Strategy Game
This was my first ever completed Unity3D game. I recreated the core game mechanics of a real-time strategy game and slapped a Pacman themed skin on top.
<br>Includes orbital camera controls, unit selection (single / box select), path finding, and enemy AI. 
<br>Fully featured with a main menu, tutorial, win / lose conditions, sound effects, particle effects, and music.
<br>This was created in Unity3D with assets created in Blender.
